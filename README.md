### What is MusicUncovered?
MusicUncovered is a twitter bot that collects data using the Spotipy API, bringing users new, popular music daily.
Currently, MusicUncovered is guided to collect data for new, popular tracks in hip hop and pop.

Follow @MusicUncovered_ on Twitter for daily updates.

### How does it work?
The bot parses through Spotify's data for new releases. For the daily _Hot Pick_ a random track with high popularity is chosen from the collection. For _Hip Hop Hot Pick_ and _Pop Hot Pick_ the bot searches for tracks with hip hop and pop genres, respectively.

Once data is collected, it is posted through the Tweepy python package.
